# 13. Roman to Integer
# Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

# Symbol       Value
# I             1
# V             5
# X             10
# L             50
# C             100
# D             500
# M             1000
# For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

# Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

# I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
# X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
# C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
# Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.



# Example 1:

# Input: s = "III"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: III = 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "LVIII"
# Output: 58
# Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
# Output: 1994
# Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.


# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 15
# s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
# It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].



class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        # vals of numerals
        romans = {
            'I': 1,

            'M': 1000
        }

        res = 0
        prev = 0

        for num in s:
            curr = romans[num]
            # if its before to subtract
            if curr > prev:
                res += curr - 2 * prev
            # else add onto it like normal
            else:
                res += curr
            #replace prev with curr to keep loop going
            prev = curr

        return res


# Question kinda confusing with the examples, but understood it wanted to increment the whole integer not just 1 of the int in the list that is the largest and return the new num

# You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.



# Example 1:

# Input: digits = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,2,4]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
# Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
# Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
# Example 2:

# Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
# Output: [4,3,2,2]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
# Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
# Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
# Example 3:

# Input: digits = [9]
# Output: [1,0]
# Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
# Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
# Thus, the result should be [1,0].


# Constraints:

# 1 <= digits.length <= 100
# 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
# digits does not contain any leading 0's.

    def plusOne(self, digits):
